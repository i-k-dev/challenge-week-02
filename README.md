# Week 02 Challenge: Portfolio for Course

A web dev portfolio page where I can add more projects to showcase my skills and talents to employers, as the course progresses. 

With these points in mind: if I don't have enough web applications to showcase at this point, I'll use placeholder images and names. 

## Description

This project takes on the 2nd week challenge which is creating a portfolio page for this bootcamp.

This is for practicing the things I've learned and to apply the skills during the 2nd module which is 'Working with CSS'.

### Essential information

## Links/Submission

* REPO: https://github.com/i-k-dev/challenge-week-02
* PAGE: https://i-k-dev.github.io/challenge-week-02/

## Acceptance Criteria

Critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
